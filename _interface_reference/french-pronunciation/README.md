## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: Custom components with shadcn/ui patterns
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Speech Recognition**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- **Text-to-Speech**: Web Speech API (browser native)

### Key Components

#### `pronunciation-practice.tsx`

Main component handling:

- Audio recording and blob creation
- API communication with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- Repetition tracking and progress management
- UI state management (recording, playing audio, showing translations)
- Phrase navigation and completion logic

#### API Route: `/api/speech-to-text`

Server-side endpoint that:

- Receives audio blob from client
- Converts to base64 for Google Cloud API
- Sends to Speech-to-Text API with French language config
- Returns transcription and confidence score

### State Management

- `currentPhraseIndex`: Tracks position in phrase array
- `repetitionCount`: Counts successful repetitions (0-5)
- `isRecording`: Recording state
- `isPlaying`: Audio playback state
- `showTranslation`: Translation visibility toggle
- `feedback`: Success/error message display

### Audio Processing

1. User clicks Record button
2. Browser MediaRecorder API captures audio
3. Audio converted to blob format
4. Sent to API route as base64
5. Google Cloud processes and returns transcription
6. App compares transcription to expected phrase
7. Feedback provided and progress updated if successful

## Design System

### Color Palette

- **Primary Blue**: `#5BA3E8` (from app icon)
- **Background**: Solid blue (`#5BA3E8`)
- **Cards**: White with subtle shadows
- **Accents**: Blue for interactive elements
- **Success**: Green (`#10b981`)
- **Error**: Red (`#ef4444`)

### Typography

- Google Cloud account with Speech-to-Text API enabled
- API credentials configured

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:
\`\`\`
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
\`\`\`

### Installation

\`\`\`bash
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the app.

## Usage Guide

1. **Start Practice**: The first phrase appears automatically
2. **Listen**: Click the speaker icon to hear correct pronunciation
3. **Check Translation**: Click the info icon to see English meaning
4. **Record**: Click "Record" and speak the French phrase clearly
5. **Review Feedback**: See if your pronunciation was accepted
6. **Repeat**: Continue until you've successfully repeated 5 times
7. **Progress**: Automatically moves to next phrase or click "Skip"

## Learning Methodology

The app implements spaced repetition and deliberate practice principles:

- **Repetition**: 5 successful attempts reinforce muscle memory
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time evaluation helps correct mistakes
- **Audio Modeling**: Hear correct pronunciation before attempting
- **Context**: Translations provide meaning and context
- **Progress Visualization**: Emotional feedback maintains motivation

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future development:

- User accounts and progress persistence
- Multiple phrase sets and difficulty levels
