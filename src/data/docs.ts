    content: `R√©p√©ter uses cutting-edge speech recognition and text-to-speech technology to help you improve your French pronunciation.

## Speech Recognition

Our app uses **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API** to analyze your pronunciation. When you record yourself speaking:

1. Your audio is captured through your device's microphone
2. The audio is sent to Google's speech recognition service
3. The service transcribes what you said in French
4. We compare the transcription to the target phrase

## Text Comparison

After transcription, we use advanced text comparison algorithms to:

- Calculate similarity scores
- Identify specific differences
- Highlight areas for improvement
- Provide actionable feedback

## Text-to-Speech

The example pronunciations use **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** with native French voices, giving you authentic pronunciation models to learn from.

## Privacy & Security

- Audio recordings are processed securely
- No audio is stored permanently
- User data is protected (see [Security](/docs/security))
- HTTPS encryption for all communications

## Accuracy

The system is highly accurate but not perfect. Factors that affect accuracy:

- Background noise
- Microphone quality
- Speaking clarity
- Regional accents
- Internet connection

For best results, practice in a quiet environment with a good microphone.`,
